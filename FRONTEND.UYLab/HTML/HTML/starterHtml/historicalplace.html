                    We were spoiled when we first visited the Colosseum of Rome staying in a luxury apartment looking directly at the Colosseum every morning from our bedroom window. It is an extraordinary sight to wake up to and people agree. The Colosseum is one of the most popular tourist destinations on Earth.

                    Not only is the Colosseum one of the most iconic historical places on earth, but it was also named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The giant amphitheater (also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre) in the heart of Rome is the top tourist attraction in Rome and one of the most famous landmarks in the world.

                    Dating back to 72 AD, The Colosseum was used for gladiators battling to their deaths. Much of Rome is a protected area and UNESCO World Heritage Site as it is filled with monuments and museums including nearby Palentine Hill, the Roman Forum, The Pantheon, and the Spanish Steps.
