                Canada has emerged as the most popular destination for Indians who want to migrate abroad for various reasons, such as education, work, business, or investment. According to the latest data from the Ministry of External Affairs, nearly 1.6 lakh Indians, accounting for 20% of those renouncing their citizenship, have opted for Canadian nationality between January 2018 and June 2023.
